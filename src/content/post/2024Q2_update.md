# Q2 Plebnet.dev update

A few items: First we have a new matrix chat room for those who prefer not to use Discord. The mentors list is not posted here on the website. If you are looking for someone to help with your goals, please check out this [page](https://plebnet.dev/mentors).

Surfersol is lead moderator in Discord, for any event scheduling or issues please feel free to reach out to hiim. Bitkarrot is taking a sabbatical to focus on other projects.

As always, keep building!
